# VBA Stock Analysis

## Overview & Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to write and refactor code in VBA to loop through all the Stock Data that was gathered by Steve and his family. 
The refactored code should take less time to run in Excel than the original code. We can then compare the results from 2017 and 2018 to determine which stocks are worth investing in.

(the VBA Macros for this challenge is under Module 3)


## Results

Below are images stating the run time for the refactored code in VBA/Excel. Both outputs ran for about .24 seconds. In the original code, both outputs ran for about .90 seconds.
In conclusion, the refactored code took about 1/3 of the time to run than the original code.

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

One advantage from refactoring code would be the decrease in run time. A clean and concise code will ultimately lower the amount of time a program requires to run and reach an output.
A refactored code can also be easier to read, depending on the person who writes it. This also leads to a disadvantage as one may not understand or be able to read another person's refactored code. If multiple people on a team refactor codes in different ways, then mistakes and errors are bound to happen. 
Refactoring code can also lead to errors, especially if is a large code that requires a lot of attention. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The original VBA script was short enough that refacotoring it made it easier to comprehend and understand. It also allowed it to run quicker, as it only took 1/3 of the time the orignal did. The refactored code used fewer steps, less memory and can be easier read by others.
